# Welcome to Android Playgrounds contributing guide

Read our [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of opening an issue, requesting changes, creating a PR, reviewing and merging a PR.

## We develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests. Any contribution you make will be reflected on the app itself âœ¨! We also use [GitHub Projects]() as a roadmap for the app.

## Getting started
We accept issues, bug reports, feature requests, discussions and pull requests.

### Issues
#### Create a new issue
If you spot a problem with the app or the code, [search if an issue already exists](). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue template]() or using a blank template.

#### Fix an issue
Scan through our [existing issues]() to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. The issues marked with the label "**task**" have been created to help you get started with contributing easily and quickly. These issues contain detailed information and steps required to add code or any other thing to the app. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Pull Request
When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request.
 - Write a summary of the pull request before proposing changes. This would help us understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
 - Don't forget to [link PR to issue]() if your fixing one.
 - Once you submit your PR, we will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.
 - We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes]() or pull request changes.
 - As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved]().
